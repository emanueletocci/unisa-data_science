# Exercise on R basic commands

# a. Load the Auto dataset using read.table or read.csv. 
# b. Verify that there are no missing data or NA data in the dataset (you can use the 
#    "na" methods). Check the contents of the dataset in terms of its features (use the "summary" function). 
# c. Produce a scatter plot showing the miles per gallon (mpg feature of the dataset)
#    as a function of the the number of cylinders (cylinders feature).
# d. Show the histogram of the miles per gallon and the estimated probability density 
#    function of the miles per gallon (use the functions "hist" and "density"). 
# e. Produce a boxplot for the miles per gallon feature.
# f. Use the "pairs" command to plot pairwise scatter plots among the dataset features.
#    Comment on the linear relation observable from the scatter plots.
